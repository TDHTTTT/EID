### Abstract 
We investigate whether state-of-the-art classification features commonly used to distinguish electrons from jet backgrounds in collider experiments are overlooking valuable information. A deep convolutional neural network analysis of electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter deposits is compared to the performance of typical features, revealing a â‰ˆ5% gap which indicates that these lower-level data do contain untapped classification power. To reveal the nature of this unused information, we use a recently developed technique to map the deep network into a space of physically interpretable observables. We identify two simple calorimeter observables which are not typically used for electron identification, but which mimic the decisions of the convolutional network and nearly close the performance gap. 

### Training
Make sure to update the path to the data location in [line 10][line10] and remove the assert statement in the previous line.

To train the models simply execute the python script training.py

```bash
python training.py 
```
